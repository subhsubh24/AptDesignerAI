# GROWTH STATUS — AptDesignerAI

The single, machine-readable source of truth for growth & marketing progress, owned by the Growth
Agent (the daily cloud routine). The factory dashboard reads the fenced GROWTH_STATUS block below,
exactly like it reads BUSINESS_CASE_SUMMARY in docs/BUSINESS_CASE.md.

## Contract (read before editing)
- The Growth Agent updates the block below every run, in the same run it does growth work.
- Real data only — never invent numbers. A metric no connected source has reported stays 0 or null.
- The block MUST be valid, parseable YAML — no invalid escapes (write $100K, never \$100K); quote any
  value containing a colon or backtick. preflight fails on a malformed block.
- Cross-project shape: identical keys across AptDesignerAI / HighlightMagic / GroceryManager.
- phase advances pre_launch -> launching -> post_launch. Post-launch is the most important window.
- as_of is stamped every update; a stale as_of is itself a signal.

## How to read it (owner)

- awaiting_connect: true + engine_built: true => engine code is live but channels not yet connected; agent prepares creative, takes no external action; see owner_blockers.
- funnel is the headline: waitlist signups pre-launch, then trial->paid + MRR + churn post-launch.
- experiments is where compounding happens post-launch; learnings is the data-grounded read.

## Phase notes

- Pre-launch: the number that matters is waitlist signups; most of the block is 0/null (correct/honest).
- Launching: trial starts + first conversions appear; experiments run on paywall + onboarding.
- Post-launch: ground every assumption on REAL conversion/retention/CAC data; run continuous
  experiments; double down on what converts; feed winners back into the business case.
