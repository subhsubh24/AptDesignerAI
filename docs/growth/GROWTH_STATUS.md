# GROWTH STATUS — AptDesignerAI

The single, machine-readable source of truth for growth & marketing progress, owned by the Growth
Agent (the daily cloud routine). The factory dashboard reads the fenced GROWTH_STATUS block below,
exactly like it reads BUSINESS_CASE_SUMMARY in docs/BUSINESS_CASE.md.

## Contract (read before editing)
- The Growth Agent updates the block below every run, in the same run it does growth work.
- Real data only — never invent numbers. A metric no connected source has reported stays 0 or null.
- The block MUST be valid, parseable YAML — no invalid escapes (write $100K, never \$100K); quote any
  value containing a colon or backtick. preflight fails on a malformed block.
- Cross-project shape: identical keys across AptDesignerAI / HighlightMagic / GroceryManager.
- phase advances pre_launch -> launching -> post_launch. Post-launch is the most important window.
- as_of is stamped every update; a stale as_of is itself a signal.
- HOW to fill funnel/experiments/learnings honestly (diagnose the binding constraint, compute
  significance, never fabricate, "insufficient data" when N is small): follow the data-science
  method in docs/growth/ANALYSIS_PLAYBOOK.md.

  learnings:
    - "CIRCUIT BREAKER FIRED (Run 3): same owner blockers for 3 consecutive runs. Single highest-leverage pair: set SITE_GATE_PASSWORD in Vercel (2 min) AND RESEND_API_KEY + RESEND_FROM_EMAIL (15 min)."
    - "Funnel remains 0/null — INTERNAL_METRICS_TOKEN not yet set; no connected source has reported numbers. Correct and honest: no fabrication."
    - "ASO keyword research conducted (Run 3): research-backed improvements identified but keyword update blocked by independent reviewer — competition estimates not verifiable via App Store Connect Search Ads. Findings logged in GROWTH_MEMORY.md for next run after owner validates."
    - "All lifecycle email infrastructure built and dry-run-ready: activation cron (A1/A2/A3 via vercel.json), win-back (E1-E3), paid_welcome_1. Waiting only for RESEND_API_KEY to go live."
  next_actions:
    - "CIRCUIT BREAKER -- Owner: set SITE_GATE_PASSWORD in Vercel (2-min setup) to enable execute-mode + flip site_gate_up to true in GROWTH_STATUS"
    - "CIRCUIT BREAKER -- Owner: set RESEND_API_KEY + RESEND_FROM_EMAIL (15-min setup) to activate all lifecycle email sends"
    - "Owner: set CRON_SECRET + apply migration 025 to activate activation email cron"
    - "Owner: set INTERNAL_METRICS_TOKEN to open funnel metrics pull API (currently 503)"
    - "Factory: add explicit email opt-out toggle to /account page (CAN-SPAM compliance for when emails go live)"
    - "Next run: verify ASO keyword competition claims via App Store Connect Search Ads before landing keyword change"

## How to read it (owner)

- awaiting_connect: true + engine_built: true => engine code is live but channels not yet connected; agent prepares creative, takes no external action; see owner_blockers.
- funnel is the headline: waitlist signups pre-launch, then trial->paid + MRR + churn post-launch.
- experiments is where compounding happens post-launch; learnings is the data-grounded read.

## Phase notes

- Pre-launch: the number that matters is waitlist signups; most of the block is 0/null (correct/honest).
- Launching: trial starts + first conversions appear; experiments run on paywall + onboarding.
- Post-launch: ground every assumption on REAL conversion/retention/CAC data; run continuous
  experiments; double down on what converts; feed winners back into the business case.
